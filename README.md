# Personal API for the personal projects gesture!

With this API, I can practice more Node.js/Express (uploading of pictures, authentication with JWT...), No-SQL database with mongoDB & mongoose and
create a hub for all my personal projects.
This way, I will be able soon to manage my [portfolio](https://github.com/Pandation/portfolio) informations (skills, experiences, educations...) from an admin office!


## First steps : 

Make this API with Node.js and the Admin office with Next.js because I'm already use to this stack.

## Finally : 

Recreate this API with Nest.js and the Admin office with Vue.js / Nuxt.js. to practice what I'm learning and mix all my knowledge.
